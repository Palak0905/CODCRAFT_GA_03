# CODCRAFT_GA_03
This project uses a first-order Markov chain to generate text by predicting the next word based on the current one. It builds a transition model from input text and generates realistic sequences. Implemented in Python, itâ€™s ideal for creative writing, language modeling, and educational demonstrations on probabilistic text generation.
